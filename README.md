## What does it do

It retrieves the sale price from each state and fetches the monthly sales prices in any given state and city. There is a user log in function to log in and save specific properties from the search, in the search users will be able to look up a specific city and state to get picture and info results for properties from the Zillow API. For the log in users can log in through google auth and that'll create an account on our app and it'll save users in our mongoDB. Once a user logs in, if they see a property they are interested in it'll save it to there saved homes page.
